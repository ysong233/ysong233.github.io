3 frameworks:

+ Keras focus on human not machine
+ Tensorflow end to end
+ Pytorch more customized, more complicated

Image Classification Famous Model: AlexNet->VGG16->ResNet (Not massive jumps)

Image Detection means detect the object and localize them.

Faster R-CNN

SSD(Single Shot Detection)

YOLO v4/v5

Mask R-CNN,

D2Det

ResNeSt-200

Dokerize them for training, (packed algorithms), TensorRT for Inference.
