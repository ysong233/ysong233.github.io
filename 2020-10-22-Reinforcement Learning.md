Combine Perception and Language

two different kind of data->Difficult

Perception: 

Language:sparse

how to communicate between models

1 model give captions, compared with people's caption and have loss functions

Complex system: seen graph->high level interactions

Paper: a differentiable scene graph generator

Reasoning with the video: Track something that we can not see

action in the video : action graph in the video

## Reinforce learning: DQN

about action and reward

can be used in playing games (chess and Atari Game)

learning how to play game seeing video clips that show how people do

traditionally used in CPU
