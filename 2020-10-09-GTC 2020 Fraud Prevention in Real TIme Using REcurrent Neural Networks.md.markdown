# American Express

Prevent fraud = Increase revenue, need to identify fraud as soon as possible.

Problem:

+ Online

+ Counterfeit

+ Lost/Stolen
+ Non-received
+ Fraud Application
+ Account Takeover

Solution: ML + Human intuition

The trained model tensferred to real application is called transfer learning (I think)

New ML technologies: Ensembling, Self Learning Models, Natiral language Processing, Anomaly Detection Automated feature engineering, GAN

WTF is this guy talking about...
