Hello and welcome to my personal blog!

I am a dedicated PhD candidate and a software/hardware engineer with a keen interest in AI Processors and innovative Non-Volatile Memory technologies. My work currently revolves around projects in Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Artificial Intelligence General Computing (AIGC).

My doctoral research is focused on both software optimization and hardware design of Deep Learning Algorithms, underpinned by Magnetic Random Access Memory. By leveraging the non-volatile characteristics of this technology, we can develop ultra-low-power AI processors. At present, I am actively seeking internship and full-time opportunities related to VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) R&D.

The purpose of this blog is to share my experiences, insights, and to foster a learning environment for both myself and my readers. Whether you're looking for tips on enhancing your coding abilities, or seeking knowledge on the latest tech trends, I aspire to provide valuable content for everyone who visits. Welcome aboard!
