Hello and welcome to my personal programming blog!
  
I am a passionate software/hardware engineer interested in DL, CV, LLM and AI Processor.
  
My doctor research includes both software and hardware optimization of Deep Learning Algorithm. Nowadays the AI industry has come to such a dangereous position that we need to be really careful with our direciton so that it won't bring us the complete devastation of human society. Not only about job position--No. The LLM training has made power consumption a more urgent problem then ever. That's why we need new hardware architecture. Since the continuing growth of human society relies on LLM and it is impossible to stop it from developing, there is at least one thing we can do -- To stop these gigantic servers consume too much power so that our human will choke on greenhouse gases after 50 years. 
  
My goal with this blog is to share my own experiences and insights, as well as to learn and grow alongside my readers. From tips on how to improve your coding skills, to insights on the latest technologies and trends, I hope to offer something of value to everyone who stops by.

4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
5. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

### As a GitHub Pages remote theme

## Customising

When using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.

To add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import "alembic";` line.

If you're looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file in your own `styles.scss`, make sure to state them before the `@import "alembic";` line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.
