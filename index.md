Hello and welcome to my personal programming blog!
  
I am a passionate PhD candidate and a software/hardware engineer interested in DL and AI Processor. Currently I'm working on CV, NLP and AIGC Projects.
  
My doctor research includes both software and hardware optimization of Deep Learning Algorithm. Nowadays the AI industry has come to such a dangereous position that we need to be really careful with our direciton so that it won't bring us the complete devastation of human society. Not only about job position--No. The LLM training has made power consumption a more urgent problem then ever. That's why we need new hardware architecture. Since the continuing growth of human society relies on LLM and it is impossible to stop it from developing, there is at least one thing we can do -- To stop these gigantic servers consume too much power so that our human will choke on greenhouse gases after 50 years. 
  
My goal with this blog is to share my own experiences and insights, as well as to learn and grow alongside my readers. From tips on how to improve your coding skills, to insights on the latest technologies and trends, I hope to offer something of value to everyone who stops by.
