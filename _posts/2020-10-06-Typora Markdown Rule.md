# Introduction

Using Typora to write markdown blogs, we can see the real-time results, which is a great advantage comparing with other markdown softwares. The official Markdown compiler that Typora supports is [Github flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

# Configure Typora as default for .markdown document

> right click any .markdown document -> Get Info -> Choose submenu"Open with" -> Change it to "Typora"

# Difference between .markdown and .md in Mac system

No differences, we can choose whichever we want.

# Frequent Shortcuts

### Titles

>  Command+1: First level Title

>  Command+2: Second Level Title

>  Command+3: Third Level Title

Besides, Typora has 6 different priorities, we can use "# to ###### + Space" before sentences to get different priorities.

For example:

"#### + Space + Example + Enter", we have:

#### Exampe

### Different Blocs

###### Quote a paragraph

 "> + Space " or "Command + Option + Q"

> For example: Command + Option + Q

###### Building a unordered list

"*/+/- + Space + Sentences", using "Delete + Tab + Shift"  or "command+option+U"to get out.

For example: "+ + Space + sentence1/2/3"

- Sentence1

- Sentence2

- Sentence3

###### Building a Ordered List 

"Number + . + Sentences"

For example "1. Hello"

1. Hello

###### Subscript

 "~ + subscript"

For example: "H + ~ 2 + ~ O"

### Horizental Line

"--- + Enter" or "*** + Enter"

For Example:

---

### Italic

"Flower + I"

For example:

*Important Notes*



### Task List

"- + Space+ [ Space ]Sentence

command + option + U"

- [ ] Task 1

### Insert Links & Hyperlinks

+ Links. Put links in "<>" <https://www.google.com>
+ Hyperlinks. "[Link Button] + (Put links here)"

### Insert some codes

"``` + Enter": We can get a Code Bloc.

For example:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

We can choose different language type to high light different grammer.
