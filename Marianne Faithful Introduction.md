# The maturation of life

This female, born in 1946, got success in 1960s (with a 'highly publicised romantic relation with Mick Jager of Rolling Stone'), and failed in 1970, because of the 'personal problem'. At that time, she was homeless, heroin addict, adn anorexic.

Although she came back with the album 'Broken English', her voise was permanently altered due to the drug abuse.

I find that quite interesting. In the news, including newspapers and Wikis, the drug addiction is always described as 'drug abuse', which makes people feel that if they do it 'correctly', drug is no big deal. And when a 20s young girl got addicted to heroine and other drugs, that's totally her personal reponsibility. "At that time, a male rock star smoke drug looked cool, while a female was a bad mother doing the same thing." I believe that this case is an example that leaving all responsibility to individuals is not appropriate. 

People may say that she finally came back, that because of her former experience she could express the raw emotions better. I doubt she would choose the same thing if there is a second chance.

Could we expect a young man/ woman always knowing better, when some terrible things could happen?

Compared with the correctness of the process, shouldn't the result be more important? Sometime people can not say the result is correct or not, because people have to choose different ways to reach the goal. Some of people will be benefitted, some will not. To make those people not realize that their benefits are damaged, people will cheat.

It's true that in many mechanisms their doesn't exist a perfect way to do things, only we really consider the result, we will be cautious about the method that we use. Leaving all the results to individuals to protect us from heart criticized is too easy.
